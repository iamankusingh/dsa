data structure is a way to arrange data in main memory (RAM) for efficient usage.
eg: array, list, linked, stack, queues, etc...

while algorithm is sequance of steps to solve a problem or effecient acess of data.

some terminologies:
database: place where data lives or oragnized.
datawherehouse: place where very large amount of data is keept.
Big data: very large data set.
legacy data: big data for future analysis
time complexity: amount of time taken by algorithm on change of input data.
space complexity: memory space taken by an algorithm to produce output.
